        <img src="../imgs/pad_kee_mao.png" alt="Pad Kee Mao dish" height="310" width="310">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Pad kee mao</strong> translates to <em>"drunken stir-fry"</em> in English. 
            These Thai drunken noodles are commonly sold by street-side 
            vendors in Bangkok. <em>Fun fact:</em> the drunken description comes from
            how late-night revelers would often make this dish
            after stumbling home from the nightclubs in 
            the wee hours of the morning.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ ounces dried Thai-style rice noodles, wide (such as Chantaboon Rice Noodles)</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon thick soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound pork (any cut), thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 serrano pepper, minced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>30 fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon thick soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup bean sprouts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with 
                hot water, and let soak until white and softened, 
                about 1 hour. Drain noodles and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a wok or large 
                skillet over low heat. Cook and stir 2 minced garlic 
                cloves until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 
                minutes. Stir in soaked noodles, 1/2 teaspoon thick 
                soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons sugar. Cook and stir until 
                noodles have absorbed soy sauce and turned brown, 
                about 3 minutes. Remove noodles from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in the 
                wok over low heat; stir in remaining 2 minced garlic 
                cloves and cook until brown and beginning to crisp, 
                2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high and stir 
                in pork, serrano pepper, basil, 1/2 teaspoon thick soy 
                sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt. Cook and stir until 
                pork is no longer pink and the edges of the meat are 
                beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Return noodles to 
                the wok and stir in bean sprouts. Cook and stir until 
                heated through, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
